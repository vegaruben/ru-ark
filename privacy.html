    <p>This Privacy Statement applies to Funnlz websites and Solutions that link to or reference this Statement and describes how we handle personal information and the choices available to you regarding collection, use, access, and how to update and correct your personal information. Additional information on our personal information practices may be provided in offer descriptions, supplemental privacy statements, or notices provided prior to or at the time of data collection.

    <h3>Collection of Your Personal Information</h3>

This helps us improve its overall accuracy and completeness, and also helps us better tailor our interactions with you.</p>
    <p>If you choose to provide Funnlz with a third party's personal information (such as name, email, and phone number), you represent that you have the third party's permission to do so. Examples include forwarding reference or marketing material to a friend or sending job referrals.

    <h3>Security of Your Personal Information</h3>
    <p>We intend to protect the personal information entrusted to us and treat it securely in accordance with this Privacy Statement.

    <h3 id="cookies">Use of Cookies and other Web Technologies</h3>
    <p>Like many websites, Funnlz uses automatic data collection tools, such as cookies, embedded web links, and web beacons. These tools collect certain standard information that your browser sends to our website. Examples include your browser type and the address of the website from which you arrived at our website.</p>
    <p>They may also collect information about:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><b>Your Internet Protocol (IP) address</b>. This is a number automatically assigned to your computer or device whenever you connect to the Internet. It is a unique address assigned by your Internet service provider or IT department on a TCP/IP network. Among other things, the IP address allows web servers to locate and identify your device.</li>
        <li><b>Clickstream behavior.</b> This includes, for example, the pages you view and the links you click. These tools help make your visit to our website easier, more efficient, and more valuable by providing you with a customized experience and recognizing you when you return.

    <p>Our website includes widgets. Widgets are interactive mini-programs that run on our site to provide specific services from other companies. Examples include displays of news, opinions, videos, and more. Personal information, such as your email address, may be collected through widgets. Widgets may also set cookies to enable them to function properly. Information collected by a widget is governed by the privacy policy of the company that created the widget.</p>
    <p>Some web browsers may give you the ability to enable a &quot;do not track&quot; feature that sends signals to the websites you visit, indicating that you do not want your online activities tracked. This is different from blocking or deleting cookies, as browsers with a &quot;do not track&quot; feature enabled may still accept cookies.</p>
    <p>No industry standard currently exists on how companies should respond to &quot;do not track&quot; signals, although one may develop in the future. Funnlz websites do not currently recognize and respond to &quot;do not track&quot; signals. If we do in the future, we will describe how in this Privacy Statement. Learn more information about <a href="//allaboutdnt.com/" target="_blank">&quot;do not track&quot;</a>.</p>
    <p>We partner with third parties to display advertising on our website or to manage our advertising on other sites.

    <h3>How to opt out of interest-based advertising:</h3>

    <p><a href="#top">back to top</a></p>
    <h3>Forums and Chat Rooms</h3>
    <p>If you participate in a discussion forum, local communities, or chat room on a Funnlz website, you should be aware that the information you provide there (i.e. your public profile) will be made broadly available to others, and could be used to contact you, send you unsolicited messages, or for purposes neither Funnlz nor you have control over. Also, please recognize that individual forums and chat rooms may have additional rules and conditions. Funnlz is not responsible for the personal information or any other information you choose to submit in these forums.

    <h3>Children's Privacy</h3>
    <p>Funnlz encourages parents and guardians to take an active role in their children's online activities.

By using our websites and Solutions or providing any personal information to us, where applicable law permits, you consent to the transfer, processing, and storage of such information outside of your country of residence where data protection standards may be different.</p>
    <p>Funnlz safeguards and enables the global transfer of personal information in a number of ways:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><h4>APEC Privacy Certification</h4>
            <p>The U.S. APEC Accountability Agent certified that Funnlz's global privacy program complies with the Asia Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) Cross-Border Privacy Rules System (CBPRs). The CBPRs provides a framework for organizations to ensure protection of personal information transferred among participating APEC economies. More information about the APEC Privacy Framework and CBPRs can be found <a href="//www.cbprs.org/" target="_blank">here</a>. Our certification applies to our business processes across our global operations that process and transfer personal information to/from our affiliates around the world. To view our certification, please visit the validation page <a href="//privacy.truste.com/privacy-seal/validation?rid=c85392b5-4521-43f7-bd03-6f005ba67125" title="TRUSTe Privacy Certification" target="_blank"><img style="border: none;" align="right" src="/c/dam/assets/swa/img/100/truste-seal.png" alt="TRUSTe Privacy Certification"></a> by clicking on the TRUSTe seal.</p>
        </li>
        <li><h4>EU-US and Swiss-US Privacy Shields</h4>
            <p>Funnlz participates in and has certified its compliance with the EU-U.S. and Swiss-US Privacy Shield Frameworks and Principles as set forth by the US Department of Commerce regarding the collection, use, and retention of personal information transferred from the European Union (EU) and Switzerland, respectively. Funnlz is committed to subjecting all personal data received from European Union (EU) member countries and Switzerland, in reliance on the EU-US and Swiss-US Privacy Shield Frameworks, to the Frameworks’ applicable Principles. If there is any conflict between the terms in this Policy and the Privacy Shield Principles, the Privacy Shield Principles shall govern.&nbsp; To learn more about these Privacy Shield Frameworks, visit the U.S. Department of Commerce's Privacy Shield&nbsp;<a href="https://www.privacyshield.gov/Program-Overview">site</a>.&nbsp;</p>
            <p>Funnlz is responsible for the processing of personal data it receives, under these Privacy Shield Frameworks, and subsequently transfers to a third party acting as an agent on its behalf. Funnlz complies with the Privacy Shield Principles for all onward transfers of personal data from the EU and Switzerland, including the onward transfer liability provisions. In certain situations, Funnlz may be required to disclose personal data in response to lawful requests by public authorities, including to meet national security or law enforcement requirements.</p>
            <p>With respect to personal data received or transferred pursuant to these Privacy Shield Frameworks, Funnlz is subject to the regulatory enforcement powers of the U.S. Federal Trade Commission.</p>
        </li>
    </ul>
    <p>If you have an unresolved privacy concern related to personal data processed or transferred by Funnlz pursuant to the CBPRs and/or Privacy Shield that Funnlz has not addressed satisfactorily, please contact (free of charge) our U.S.-based third party dispute resolution provider by clicking <a href="https://feedback-form.truste.com/watchdog/request" target="_blank">here</a>. Under certain conditions more fully described on the Privacy Shield website, you may be entitled to invoke binding arbitration when other dispute resolution procedures have been exhausted.</p>
    <p><a href="#top">back to top</a></p>
    <h3>Your California Privacy Rights</h3>
    <p>Residents of the State of California, under California Civil Code § 1798.83, have the right to request from companies conducting business in California a list of all third parties to which the company has disclosed personal information during the preceding year for direct marketing purposes. Alternatively, the law provides that if the company has a privacy policy that gives either an opt-out or opt-in choice for use of your personal information by third parties (such as advertisers) for marketing purposes, the company may instead provide you with information on how to exercise your disclosure choice options.</p>
    <p>Funnlz qualifies for the alternative option. We have a comprehensive privacy statement, and provide you with details on how you may either opt-out or opt-in to the use of your personal information by third parties for direct marketing purposes. Therefore, we are not required to maintain or disclose a list of the third parties that received your personal information for marketing purposes during the preceding year.</p>
    <p>If you are a California resident and request information about how to exercise your third party disclosure choices, please <a href="mailto:privacy@funnlz.io">email us your request</a>.</p>
    <p><a href="#top">back to top</a></p>
